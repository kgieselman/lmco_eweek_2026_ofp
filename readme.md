# Lockheed Martin E-week Competition 2026
The 2026 E-Week competition involves creating a remote controlled vehicle
that can collect and deposit ping pong balls and cabbages. It also needs
to be able to launch ping pong balls to hit a target.

## Objectives

### Collect
    Each lap 4 ping pong balls can be deposited so at least 4 should be collected.
    More can be collected and held for multiple laps.

### Deposit
    Each lap up to 4 ping pong balls can be deposited. Any excess will simply 
    be returned to the main ball pit. Ideally only 4 will be depsoited.

### Launch
    Each lap, up to 4 ping pong balls can be launched toward targets. These
    are separte ping pong balls from those being collected. These are manually
    fed by a teammate near the ball pit.

## Design

### Drive Train
    This year's design is using a Mecanum drive train with 4 powered omnidirectional
    wheels. 

### Collect

### Deposit

### Launch
